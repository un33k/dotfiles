the python_open_module.vim is the script that allows you open the module file  below the cursor when coding python. It's easy to use. For example, you can create a new python file and input:

import string

move the cursor above "string" and press "<LocalLeader>oo"("\oo" in common in vim) in normal mode You could see the string.py file opened in current window. you can continue to input:

string.lower

do same above and you can see string.py file opened the cursor jump into lower function.

the open fail if the module is buildin such as 'sys' or is not available.

There are three options for mapping key, you can chang it to any other key:

pom_key_open='<LocalLeader>oo'              # open module file in the current window
pom_key_open_in_win='<LocalLeader>ow'             # open module file in a new window
pom_key_open_in_tab='<LocalLeader>ot'               # open module file in a tab


WORNING: Required vim compiled with +python
